Project submission:

Note: All csv files must contain field names (header, i.e. "header"), separated by a comma. Files should not contain indexes from dataframe.

Recommendations for code file (ipynb):

The file should contain headers and comments Repetitive operations are better designed as functions If possible add graphs describing data (about 3-5) Add only the best model, i.e. do not include all variants of the project into the code The project script must work from start to finish (from loading the data to unloading the predictions) The entire project must be in one script (ipynb file). When using statistics (mean, median, etc.) as attributes, it is better to count them on tray, and then on validation and test data do not count statistics again, and take them from tray. The project should work out completely for a reasonable time (no more than 10 minutes), so in the final version is better not to include GridSearch with large numbers of combinations of parameters.
